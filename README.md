## Refactoring Practice

Copy this template repository to your own Github account. Then clone it to your computer and do the refactorings.  Push your work to Github.

Each subdirectory contains some code that needs refactoring.

1. In this README, write one line describing each refactoring you apply and why.
2. Perform the refactoring in the subdirectory code.


## `time/timestamp.py`
1. rename method match to pydocstyle.
2. Change a condition to method to easy to understand.
3. define args to tuple type for easy to understand.
4. delete elseif because it  is not necessary.


## `game_framework/gamelib.py`

Look for refactorings in the class `GameApp`.

* Avoid side-effects: replace side effect with return value (the caller must use the return value)

* Encapsulate a collection - provide behavior that subclasses of GameApp need instead of requiring them to manipulate a collection that belongs to the GameApp class.
  - Hint: `elements`  

**Refactor:**  
  - Replace string literal with name constant
  - Create add_element() and remove_element() for encapsulating the element  
  - Modify create_canvas() return the object and set canvas get value from parameter create_canvas().

## `recipe/recipe.py` and `recipe/main.py`

This uses a `dataclass`, which requires Python 3.7.

The Recipe class defines a recipe for a hot beverage with attributes:
* name - name of the recipe
* coffee - units of coffee
* chocolate - units of chocolate
* milk - units of milk
* sugar - units of sugar
* price - (float) price in Baht

Refactor `main.py`.  What can you do to eliminate the long, boring code?  
**Refactor:**
- Create the `create_recipe` function to create `Recipe` Class directly and to easy to create objects.
